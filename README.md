        rep = 0,                          ~ The required reputation to be able to purchase the item.
        type = "Cash",                    ~ The mode of payment can be either "Items" | "Cash" | "Crypto" 
        costs = {                         ~ The Cost/Requirement to purchase the item. 
            ["Cash"] = 25000,             ~ The Name and Cost of the Required item. Should be "Cash" for cash and "Crypto" for crypto.
